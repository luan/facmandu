-- Shared "resolve a surface" helper for every engine tool that takes one. The
-- one contract: a name or an index goes in, a LuaSurface or a found = false
-- reply comes out. No surface-taking tool resolves its own argument.
--
-- Unlike force_lookup, a miss here is not an error. The surface is the argument
-- a model guesses most often: a planet it remembers from another save, a
-- platform that has since been scrapped, a name a player typed from memory. A
-- tool that errors on a guess costs the agent a whole round and tells it
-- nothing, so these tools answer found = false and name the tool that lists the
-- real surfaces instead.
--
-- An index is accepted because list_surfaces publishes one on every row, and a
-- model that passes back what it was just shown deserves an answer rather than
-- "surface is required". That wording is now reserved for a genuinely absent
-- argument.
--
-- API names verified against the official 2.0.77 docs (fetched 2026-09-10):
-- LuaGameScript::surfaces, LuaCustomTable[uint32 or string -> LuaSurface],
-- "this sparse table allows you to find surfaces by indexing it with either
-- their name or index"; LuaSurface::name; LuaSurface::index; LuaSurface::valid.
