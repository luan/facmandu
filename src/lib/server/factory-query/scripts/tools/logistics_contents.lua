-- What one logistic network is holding, aggregated the way a player thinks
-- about it: by item name, with the qualities folded in.
--
-- get_contents returns one row per name and quality pair, so a base that makes
-- the same plate at three qualities spends three of the reply's rows saying
-- "iron plate" and reports a distinct_items count nobody asked for. Summing by
-- name first means the eight rows that come back are the eight biggest STACKS,
-- and a name with more than one quality carries a qualities breakdown so the
-- detail is not lost.
--
-- API names verified against the official 2.0.77 docs (fetched 2026-09-10):
--   LuaLogisticNetwork::get_contents() -> array[ItemWithQualityCount], a fresh
--   array the caller may sort in place; ItemWithQualityCount is
--   {name :: string, quality :: string, count :: ItemCountType}.

--- A name held at one quality gets no breakdown, because on most saves
--- everything is normal and a repeated "normal" on every row is reply bytes
--- spent saying nothing. The one exception is a name held at a single quality
--- that is not normal, which keeps that quality on the row: those 2,000 plates
--- being uncommon is the whole point of the row.
