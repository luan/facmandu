-- entity_count: how many of one entity a force owns on one surface. The count
-- happens inside the engine, over the whole surface, so this is one C++ pass and
-- not a Lua walk over entities however large the base is.
--
-- API names verified against the official 2.0.77 docs (fetched 2026-09-10),
-- https://lua-api.factorio.com/2.0.77/classes/LuaSurface.html,
-- https://lua-api.factorio.com/2.0.77/concepts/EntitySearchFilters.html and
-- https://lua-api.factorio.com/2.0.77/classes/LuaPrototypes.html:
--   LuaSurface::count_entities_filtered(filter) -> uint32
--   EntitySearchFilters: area, position and radius are all optional, so a filter
--     with none of them covers the surface; name :: EntityID or array[EntityID];
--     force :: ForceSet
--   prototypes, the global LuaPrototypes object, ::entity
--     LuaCustomTable[string -> LuaEntityPrototype]

-- One count_entities_filtered is a C++ pass over a surface, not a Lua walk, but
-- a sweep multiplies them: every force against every surface.
--
-- The sweep does not add game time, it removes round trips. A force owns
-- entities on its own surface and almost nowhere else, so the passes that find
-- nothing are cheap and only a handful do real work, and those same passes were
-- always going to run. Question 64 on 2026-09-15 asked how many solar panels
-- each team had and cost fourteen entity_count calls in one round: fourteen
-- RCON trips for engine work that one trip can carry.
--
-- So MAX_PASSES guards the pathological shape rather than the ordinary one. The
-- measured server runs 23 surfaces against 14 populated forces, 322 passes; a
-- save that has accumulated a hundred space platforms (surfaces.lua says they
-- do) against twenty teams is 2000, and that one refuses and says which
-- argument makes it affordable. docs/design/phase4-spec.md, "Bounding a walk"
-- and "Refusal as a Lua contract".
