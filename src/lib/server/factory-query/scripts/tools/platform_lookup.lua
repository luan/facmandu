-- The four platform columns shared by list_surfaces and entity_count's
-- per_surface breakdown, so a platform surface reads the same way in both
-- tools: which team owns it, where it is stopped, what it is doing. One
-- place, so the two cannot drift on what a platform row looks like.
--
-- API names verified against the 2.0.77 docs,
-- /home/shobhitg/factorio/doc-html/runtime-api.json:
--   LuaSurface::platform -> LuaSpacePlatform, optional.
--   LuaSpacePlatform::name (string), ::force (LuaForce, never nil),
--     ::space_location (LuaSpaceLocationPrototype, optional: nil while the
--     platform is in flight between locations), ::state
--     (defines.space_platform_state), ::scheduled_for_deletion (uint32,
--     never nil: "0 if not scheduled for deletion").
--   LuaPrototypeBase::name, inherited by LuaSpaceLocationPrototype.
--
-- scheduled_for_deletion is a tick count, not a boolean: `if not
-- platform.scheduled_for_deletion` is false for every healthy platform,
-- because 0 is truthy in Lua, so that naive test would skip every one of
-- them. The correct test, used below, is `(x or 0) == 0`.

-- The engine's states as words an answer can use as they are. on_the_path
-- is "in flight": the words the assistant is told to say for a ship between
-- planets, so nothing downstream has to recognise the engine's own term
-- (the sweep's platform label once tested for "on_the_path" against this
-- table's words, and its "in flight" never printed).

--- Adds platform, owner, location and state to `row` when `surface` carries a
--- live platform, leaving `row` untouched otherwise: an ordinary planet
--- surface, or a platform pending deletion, reads exactly as it did before
--- this module existed. `location` is left unset rather than nil while the
--- platform is in flight, so the JSON writer drops it rather than the caller
--- having to.
--- The platform `surface` carries, or nil when it carries none, when the
--- object has been invalidated, or when one is already counting down to
--- deletion. Takes anything with a `.platform` field shaped like a
--- LuaSpacePlatform rather than a real LuaSurface, so a test can hand it a
--- plain table.
---
--- This is the single definition of "live platform". It lived in two files
--- once, and the copies had already drifted: one checked `.valid` and the
--- other did not, so an invalidated platform read as live on one path and not
--- the other.
