-- Shared row bounds for the enumerating tools. Every tool that lists things
-- has to say how many it will return and stop there: the rpc reply is refused
-- whole once it passes the byte cap (CONTEXT.md invariant 4), so an unbounded
-- list is a tool that works on a fresh map and answers too_large on a server
-- that has been up a month.
--
-- The pattern every caller follows: collect the rows, sort them, cut to
-- limit(), and report `total` beside `shown` so the agent can say "200 known,
-- 12 online" instead of believing it saw everything.

local M = {}

--- The row cap every force sweep shares. A scenario mod can run dozens of
--- forces, so a sweep that answers for all of them still has to stop
--- somewhere, and it must stop at the same place in every tool.
M.MAX_FORCES = 100

--- A caller's limit, clamped to 1..max, `default` when it is missing or not a
--- number.
function M.limit(value, default, max)
  local n = math.floor(tonumber(value) or default)
  if n < 1 then n = 1 end
  if n > max then n = max end
  return n
end

--- The first n rows, in the order they are already in. Sort before calling, so
--- which rows survive a cut is stable rather than whatever pairs() produced.
function M.cut(rows, n)
  local out = {}
  for i = 1, math.min(n, #rows) do out[i] = rows[i] end
  return out
end

--- ROW_BUDGET is what the rows of one reply may encode to, left clear of
--- rpc.lua's CAPS.call = 8000 so the fields wrapped around them still fit.
M.ROW_BUDGET = 6000

--- The first rows that fit a byte budget, for a reply whose rows are wide
--- enough that a row count is the wrong unit to bound them in.
---
--- M.cut alone bounds rows by COUNT, which was right while a row was
--- {force, count} and became wrong the moment a row could carry a platform,
--- its owner, its location and its state: 100 such rows encode past the
--- 8000-byte call cap, and an over-cap reply is refused whole, so the tool
--- spends every pass and then answers nothing the model can act on. Measured:
--- entity_count per_surface died at 32 surfaces and list_surfaces reached 7794
--- bytes at its own default row count.
---
--- Binary search rather than dropping a row at a time, so a wide reply costs
--- about seven encodes instead of one per row discarded.
function M.fit(rows, budget)
  budget = budget or M.ROW_BUDGET
  if #rows == 0 then return rows end
  local function fits(n)
    return #helpers.table_to_json(M.cut(rows, n)) <= budget
  end
  if fits(#rows) then return rows end
  local low, high = 0, #rows
  while low < high do
    local mid = math.floor((low + high + 1) / 2)
    if fits(mid) then low = mid else high = mid - 1 end
  end
  return M.cut(rows, low)
end

--- Sorts rows by their `name` field, in place, and returns them.
function M.by_name(rows)
  table.sort(rows, function(x, y) return x.name < y.name end)
  return rows
end

--- The one rounding helper every double in a reply passes through: four
--- decimals for an evolution factor, two for a progress fraction, a rate or an
--- hour count.
---
--- Why it exists at all: helpers.table_to_json writes a double at full
--- round-trip precision, so an evolution factor of 0.31 reaches the model as
--- 0.3100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625. Fifty-odd bytes of
--- the reply's budget spent on digits that carry no information, and a figure
--- the model may quote back at a player verbatim.
---
--- Anything that is not a number comes back untouched, so an absent progress
--- stays absent rather than becoming 0.
---
--- Rounding the double is not enough: the engine's JSON writer prints any
--- non-integer double at full precision, so a rounded 0.79 still leaves as
--- 0.79000000000000003552713678800500929355621337890625 (measured on 2.0.77).
--- A whole number leaves as a number; anything else leaves as the short
--- decimal string, "1.79", which a model reads as the figure it is.
