-- Force labels: what players call a force (docs/design/phase3-spec.md,
-- "Force labels"). A team mod knows that "team-1" is Team Ace; the companion
-- does not, and a player must never read team-1 for a team they know as
-- Team Ace. Any remote interface exposing a zero-argument `force_labels_v1`
-- returning { [force_name] = label } is a labels provider, found by scan
-- like every other probe and never stored. The swap happens at the edges:
-- the service turns labels into force names in the question, the renderer
-- here turns force names back into labels, and the model never learns the
-- mapping or pays a token for it.

--- A label as it renders: its own colour and font tags kept, every other

--- and stripping that meant the companion never once printed a team name in
--- its colour; the colours players saw were tags the model had written
--- itself, which is what blew an answer past its byte budget. Only color

--- provider might slip in, and those never make it past here.
