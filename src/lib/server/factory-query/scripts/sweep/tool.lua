-- sweep: the one tool answering "which force, surface, platform or player
-- has the most of something", across every one of them in a single call
-- instead of one call per force (docs/design/phase5-sweep.md). Registered on
-- the companion's own tool provider by scripts/tools/engine.lua exactly like
-- every other tool module; the walk, the axis vocabulary and the metric
-- registry it delegates to live alongside this file, under scripts/sweep/.
--
-- This file owns only the manifest and the thin function wrapper walk.run
-- needs; it decides nothing about metrics, axes or budgets itself.
